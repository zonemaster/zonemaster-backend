v7.0.0 2021-09-15 (public security release)
 [Fixes]
 - By design adding a API user (needed for the batch function) is limited to
   connections over localhost. With a default GUI installation with reverse
   proxy all connections are over localhost, which means that adding a API
   user is publicly available if the GUI is publicly available. If you can
   add API users, then you can start several large batch jobs which may
   overload the Zonemaster system. (#838, #850)
   - Makes RPCAPI use the real remote IP for verification to restore the
     limitation that the API key can only be added from localhost.
   - Disables RPCAPI method "add_api_user" by default.
   - Adds configuration key for "backend_config.ini" to enable RPCAPI method
     "add_api_user".
   - Adds configuration key for "backend_config.ini" to disnable RPCAPI method
     "add_batch_job".
 - Prevents RPCAPI daemon to recreate workers when workers crashed to do error
   in configuration file. This is a FreeBSD specific error. (#813, #862)
